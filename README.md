# DeepLearningAssignment
This is my first DL assignment. I have taken MNIST dataset and training a NN model on it using the softmax function since we can't use sigmoid function for multi-class classification. The basic idea is to get a probability distribution of different classes. Since MNIST dataset contains 10 digits (i.e., 0-9), we will have 10 nodes (or units) at output layer, each having some probability and the node with maximum probabilty will give the desired result
